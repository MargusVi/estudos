	Number of Classes: 17
	Signals per Class: 1000
	Length of Each Signal (samples): 100
	Length of Each Signal (time): 20 ms
	Amplitude of Each Signal: Scaled between -1 to 1

Data Format:
	The dataset is available in two formats: MATLAB and CSV.

MATLAB File:
	Filename: 5Kfs_1Cycle_50f_1000Sam_1A.mat
	Structure: A matrix of dimensions (1000 x 100 x 17), where:
	1000 = Signals per class
	100 = Samples per signal
	17 = Number of classes
	Class Order:
		Pure_Sinusoidal

CSV Files:
	Files: 17 CSV files, one for each class.
	Structure: Each CSV file has dimensions (1000 x 100), where:
		1000 = Signals per class
		100 = Samples per signal

Usage:
This dataset is designed to support the development and testing of power quality recognition systems. The 17 classes cover a broad range of power quality disturbances, providing a comprehensive resource for training machine learning models and validating their performance in recognizing various types of power quality issues.
